## Overview
This is a code written in Jupyter notebook which downloads and saves images according to the search term entered by the user.

## Motivation
During this pandemic and lockdown, I started to learn Machine Learning algorithms and the mathematics used behind them. It was important to apply these algorithms to real world scenarios and deploy them. But, to train these models, sometimes large number of images are requierd (in case of image classification techniques) for which extracting thousands of images is a tedious task. Hence, I tried to automate it.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. You can install the latest chrome webdriver according to your chrome version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Once this is done, you can simply download the jupyter notebook, run it line by line to execute the code.
